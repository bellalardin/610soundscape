The original idea behind my soundscape narrative was to create a contrast between the busy sounds of campus and a very personal conversation between two friends. For the final iteration of the soundscape, I ended up with 8 tracks: six noise tracks, one instrumental track, and one vocal track. For the most part, I stuck with my original idea and vision, with two significant differences:

-I included an improvised piano instrumental.
-Only one person is speaking during the majority of the vocal track.

Both of these changes were pretty impulsive decisions. I recorded the piano track with no intention of using it for the project, then realized a few days later it might sound cool. The vocal track was recorded while I was playing a game called We're Not Really Strangers with my friend Gaby. I had originally planned on using both of our answers to the question, but I was so moved by her answer that I didn't want to cut any of it out. I had only set aside about 90 seconds for the vocal track, and it ended up fitting within the time limit almost perfectly, so I left it basically unedited except for volume control. 

I used reverb and change tempo effects was to make the noise sound noisier. I edited the tracks recorded on buses and street corners before I had even made the decision to put in a piano track, so I made these edits with the intention of creating enough noise to sound musical. Although I did end up adding the piano later, I still feel that these effects (reverb in particular) helped to create the ambiance I wanted for the overall track. All of the other effects I selected were used mainly for volume control, as the baseline volume levels of each track varied wildly. I found that some of these effects (fade in/out, amplify, envelope tool) were much easier to use than others (auto duck). I could only get auto duck to work the way I wanted it to on one track, but I found that combining amplify with the envelope tool produced a similar effect. I opted for using these two effects together for the remainder of the tracks.

The inspiration for my soundscape came from my own personal experiences. I'm heavily involved with the DIY music scene in Pittsburgh; it's where I've made most of my friends and where I feel most at home. In other words, the places where I find the most intimacy and community are also the places where I'm surrounded by noise. I wanted to capture the idea that the level of intimacy you would normally only expect when you're alone with friends can still happen in a crowded, loud environment. At the same time, I wanted to showcase the importance of close friendships over work/school/nightlife. Since these ideas are somewhat contradictory, I would consider my soundscape to be effective if a listener picks up on at least one of them.
