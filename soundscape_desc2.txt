Hi! This is my repo for my ENGCMP 0610 soundscape project. My idea for this project was to create a blend of various sounds recorded on or around Pitt's main campus, then layer it with a vocal track. The vocal track is the only thing missing, and all other tracks have been edited fully. All of the current tracks were recorded on my phone (not downloaded), all have been cut, and some have been pitched and distorted to create the kind of sound that I wanted.

The soundscape is just over two minutes long. I made a decision to add a piano track in, which I hadn't originally planned on, but I think it ties the theme together without feeling out of place. The vocal track will be layered over the piano and will last about 90 seconds. Although I don't have the track yet, I have a clear vision for what I want it to be like. I don't think I will put any effects on the vocals, but I may muffle my phone microphone to create the sound that I want.

For now, while you're listening, you can try to figure out where I recorded from. I think a few are obvious if you listen to them closely, while others are too short or edited too much to be able to tell, but I could be totally wrong. Thanks for listening :)
