Hi! This is my repo for my ENGCMP 0610 soundscape project. My idea for this project was to create a blend of various sounds recorded on or around Pitt's main campus, then layer it with a vocal track. I'm still working on the second part, but I have a better idea for how I want it to sound now. All of the current tracks were recorded on my phone (not downloaded), almost all have been cut, and some have been pitched and distorted to create the kind of sound that I wanted.

Everything in the first 55 seconds has been edited, after that I still have to go in and change things. The main vocal track is the last key element that I'm missing, but I would like to add/layer more tracks from the preexisting tracks as well. I will likely do a lot more experimenting with Audacity's effects, so the end product may sound completely different, but it will still come from the same source material.
